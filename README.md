# A Walk Through Code

*A Walk Through Code* is a game that I created as part of my capstone course at Texas A&M University.  My teammates on this project were Garrett Garbee, Harrison Foster, and Ruben Cardenas.  

The premise of the game is that it functions as a visual way to teach basic programming concepts to those unfamiliar with them.  Due to my work in Texas A&M's LIVE Lab, I frequently interact with Visualization majors who take intro programming courses, only to struggle because they haven't been introduced to certain programming fundamentals.  

With this in mind, we designed and created a way to represent the flow of a program in a 3D VR space through the use of a ball rolling down a track.  Switch tracks represent if-statements, teleporter tracks function like JMP commands and can be used to simulate loops or entire functions.  A color-changer track lets you set the color of the ball and "define a variable".

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the scripts that we used or modified (we imported the SteamVR API for Unity 3D) to create the game.  The purpose of the repository is to display them as an example of my technical capabilities, though I assume it will quickly become dated like some of my other repositories.

## My Contributions

Due to my experience with previous projects, I intended to focus primarily on the VR interface.  However, it quickly became clear that I was the most experienced member on the team and I ended up writing much more than the VR controls.  Aside from the basic track design, I also implemented everything within the final Unity scenes.
